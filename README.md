# Pokescan-AI
AI model to recognize Pok√©mon trading cards using Kria board

## üìå Project Overview

Pok√©Scan-AI is an edge AI project designed to detect and classify Pok√©mon trading cards using computer vision. The system preprocesses card images, prepares them for training, and will later deploy an optimized model to the Xilinx Kria board for real-time inference.

The goal is to recognize different Pok√©mon cards based on visual features like character artwork, text, and layout.

Currently, the project supports:
- Preprocessing card images (resize and convert to RGB)
- A small set of sample Pok√©mon card images
- Ready-to-use training data format

Planned next steps:
- Train a lightweight CNN classification model
- Deploy the model using Vitis AI tools on Kria
- Integrate live camera scanning from Kria board

## Setup

To get started with Pok√©Scan-AI:

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Preprocess images**  
This script resizes card images and prepares them for model training:

python scripts/preprocess.py


Processed images will be saved in the `data/processed/` directory (excluded from Git).
